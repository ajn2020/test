      "Hounslow Council's Garden Waste collection service provides residents with 25 fortnightly collections from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, with a break of two weeks over the Christmas period. The service is a convenient, low-cost way for residents with gardens to dispose of cuttings throughout the year. Residents are advised to sign up before 1 April to ensure they receive the service in full. This will ensure that current subscribers don’t experience any interruption to their service and new subscribers are set up ahead of their first collection on 1 April. The cost for the service for the year is £65.00 or £32.50 for those in receipt of Council Tax Reduction (support). If you're currently a Garden Waste subscriber and paid with direct debit last year - please be careful not to subscribe again as you may be due to renew automatically, so look out for notifications about your subscription before renewing.",
